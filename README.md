## User story
As AN INDECISIVE PERSON who needs help curating an evening
I WANT a simple application that can recommend different activities
SO THAT I can try new things and enjoy my evening.

## General info
Our team was motivated by the monotony of quarantine life to create something that aids us in developing an evening to unwind after the sometimes grueling work weeks we’ve experienced. At times, it’s hard to put effort into unwinding after a long week, but it’s extremely important to be able to sit back, relax, and let the stresses of the work week go. Our application creates a one stop shop for a user to plan out an evening with nothing but an idea of a movie in their head and a knowledge of their current pantry stock.
